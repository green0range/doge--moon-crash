# Name?

# Contirbute
If you really feel like adding to this quick afternoon project, then make sure any pull requests are helping a cause of getting doge to the moon, without crashing.

# Key mapping
I use a Dvorak keyboard, so I'm kinda sensitive about keyboard remapping in games, of cause this supports it. Simply edit 'keyboard.config'. I've set a whole bunch of presets there, or you can define your own - follow the same format I've used. When you've selected the one you want, set 'using=preset name' at the bottom of the file. I've set the default to qwerty because I understand how unusal I am with my layout choices. (but Dvorak, such better!)
